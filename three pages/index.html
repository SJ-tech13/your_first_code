				<p> Flowers have been used to represent certain emotions and meanings in many cultures throughout history, but it is perhaps the Victorian era that is best known for using flowers as a way to communicate indirectly. This way of sending messages was rather complicated with many flowers having more than one meaning or more than one flower being used to represent a certain thought.</p>
